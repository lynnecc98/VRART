Rain works on mobile / PC / console vertexlit / forward / deferred renderer and dx9, dx11, openGL.
To use, simply move the prefab of rain to the scene. Also, rain works in the world space. So, you can attach the prefab to main camera. (it allow you to do infinite rain which follow to camera)
Standard prefabs have an area of 10 by 10 meters. You can change the scale if necessary. As well, you can increase the amount of water droplets in the tab "emission-> Rate".
If necessary, you can change the distortion drops by setting the "distortion" shader "WaterDrop".
